# 1 Introduction
In this lab we dove into the coverage matrix and analyzed Instruction Coverage, Branch Coverage, Lines Coverage, Method Cover, Complexity Coverage, and Types Coverage using the EclEmma Coverage tools. Given these tools we were able to learn more about testing methods and enhance our programs.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test
## Range
Detailed Testing Strategy for Selected New Unit Tests
1. testConstructorWithInvalidBounds
Objective: Ensure the Range constructor throws an IllegalArgumentException when given a lower bound greater than the upper bound.
Method Under Test: Range(double lower, double upper)
Strategy:
Invoke the constructor with a lower bound greater than the upper bound (e.g., new Range(2, 1)).
Use JUnit's expected exception mechanism to verify that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
This test directly increases method and statement coverage by exercising constructor validation logic.
2. testGetLength
Objective: Verify that the getLength method accurately calculates the length of the range.
Method Under Test: getLength()
Strategy:
Create ranges with known lengths (including zero and positive values).
Assert that getLength returns the correct value for each range.
This test increases statement coverage by exercising the calculation path within getLength.
3. testShiftWithExtremeDelta
Objective: Examine the behavior of the shift method when shifting a range by extremely large positive and negative deltas.
Method Under Test: shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowZeroCrossing)
Strategy:
Shift a range by Double.MAX_VALUE and -Double.MAX_VALUE to test the handling of extreme values.
Verify that the resulting range's bounds are correctly adjusted, including checks for infinity bounds if applicable.
This test contributes to branch coverage by covering code paths that handle large shifts, potentially testing overflow behavior.
4. testCombineRangeWithItself
Objective: Confirm that combining a range with itself returns a range equal to the original.
Method Under Test: combine(Range range1, Range range2)
Strategy:
Combine a range with itself and verify that the result is equal to the original range.
This test enhances method and statement coverage, particularly testing the idempotency of the combine method.
5. testContainsValueBelowLowerBound
Objective: Test the contains method to ensure it correctly identifies values below the range's lower bound.
Method Under Test: contains(double value)
Strategy:
Use a range and test with a value below its lower bound, asserting that contains returns false.
This test improves branch coverage by ensuring conditions checking if a value is within the range are correctly evaluated.

## DataUtilites
Detailed Testing Strategy for Selected New Unit Tests
1. calculateColumnTotalForEmptyValues2D
Objective: To ensure calculateColumnTotal correctly handles a Values2D object with zero rows, returning a total of 0.0.
Strategy:
Mock a Values2D object to create  a simulation scenario with no rows and verify that the method returns 0.0. This test checks the method's ability to handle empty datasets, which is usefull for checking  divide-by-zero errors or null pointer exceptions which are essential.

2.testGetCumulativePercentagesWithEmptyKeyedValues
Objective: To confirm that getCumulativePercentages can correctly process an empty KeyedValues object, producing an empty result.
Strategy: 
Mock an empty KeyedValues object and assert that the output is also empty. This scenario tests  method's ability to take care of empty inputs ensuring that it does not fail or return invalid data.

3. calculateRowTotalWithInvalidColumnCount
Objective: To validate that calculateRowTotal returns 0.0 when the specified row has an invalid (less than expected) number of columns.
Strategy:
Mock a Values2D object with a specified number of rows and columns, then test with an index that exceeds the actual column count, checking for a return value of 0.0. This test makes sure the method  handles data structure dimensions that do not match expectations.

4. testCreateNumberArray2DWithEmptyInputArray
Objective: To verify that createNumberArray2D correctly handles an empty input array, returning an empty Number[][].
Strategy:
Provide an empty double array as input and assert that the output is an empty Number[][] array. This test checks the method's capabiltiy to handle empty inputs without errors, which is an important  aspect of robust utility functions.

5. calculateColumnTotalForNullValues
Objective: To ensure that calculateColumnTotal accurately computes a total of 0.0 when all values in the specified column are null.
Strategy:
 Mock a Values2D object with null values and verify the method returns 0.0. This scenario tests the method's null values, preventing null pointer exceptions and making sure that the calculations are accurate..   

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage
## Range 

testConstructorWithInvalidBounds: Increases method coverage by invoking the constructor in an invalid usage scenario. It also enhances statement coverage by executing the exception-throwing code path within the constructor.

testGetLength: This test case systematically increases statement coverage by invoking getLength on ranges of varying lengths, including edge cases like zero-length ranges. It helps in validating the correctness of the range length calculation logic.

testShiftWithExtremeDelta: Significantly impacts branch coverage by triggering boundary conditions within the shift method, especially handling cases where shifting results in values that exceed the floating-point range, potentially touching upon overflow behavior.

testCombineRangeWithItself: Boosts both method and statement coverage. It uniquely tests the combine method's behavior when the same range is used as both arguments, verifying the method's handling of such scenarios and ensuring idempotency.

testContainsValueBelowLowerBound: Enhances branch coverage by testing a specific branch within the contains method—when the value is below the lower bound of the range. This case is crucial for validating the correctness of boundary condition checks within the method.

In the above context we werent able to retrieve a statment coverage, due to the constructor class. The constructor class initially checks if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound. In the conceding methods we werent able to check some of the statments due to this requirment already being met. This results in us not being able to use these statments and lowering pur statment coverage. This is demonstrated in the image above.

We were able to achieve the required coverages for each type using new test cases. It took a little bit of trial error to make sure they helped with increasing coverage and not dropping it instead.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

EclEmma:
  P:
    Covers the majority of the key metrics we were looking to solve. 
    Easily Compatible with the Eclipse IDE.
    Easy visualization of metric Coverages
  C:
    EclEmma lacks the condition coverage metric.

Instruction Coverage:
  P:
    Instruction coverage is very simple and easy to calculate. It is the measurement of the number of lines that are executed.
    Provides a source of detection allowing for tests to be generated based off segments that aren't executed.
  C:
    Does not provide a great indication in the quality of tests. Although excess lines can be run it doesn't mean that all tests are executed.
Branch Coverage
  P:
    Finds components of codes that arent tested by checking each branch (conditional statements) 
    Typically more thorough than instruction coverage because it test each point in which a condition is met and potentially returned.
  C:
    It is very difficult to obtain complete branch coverage. Complex code also can lead to all bugs not being found.
    All conditions may not have their bugs found.
	
Line Coverage:
  P:
    Simple and easy to calculate, works on executable lines of code rather than machine level lines of code. 
    Similar to instruction coverage in sense that it can discover untested units of code.
  C:
    Can have missing test cases for a line of code that has been tested.
    Not as detailed as instruction as it works on executable lines of code rather than machine codes. May overestimate lines that carry multiple decisions.
    
Method Coverage:
  P:
    Ensure each method in the code is called one or more times. It ensures that basic test cases are covered.
    Make sure each method is tested, and any missing methods are identified.
  C:
    Each method may not be fully tested of all its components. Does Not ensure the method is functioning at a 100% success rate.
    Doesnt test multitude of inputs passed into functions. Hence it also doesnt test every path. This relates to the previous bullet point.
Complexity Coverage:
  P:
    Detail oriented, in the sense that it tests areas that are more likely to have bugs.
    Has the potential to improve the quality of code, by simplifying complex aspects of code while reducing bugs.
  C:
    Harder to measure and calculate, especially when dealing with more intricate code.
    Although detail oriented, may not test all function and scenarios of code
Types Coverage:
  P:
    Tests a variety of input types to methods and functions.
    Common for statically typed programming languages.
    Identify type errors, type usage and type conversion
  C:
    Typically used in staticaly typed programming languages. May have  a lack of relevance in regard to dynamically typed programming languages.
    Large number of type test cases to cover all scenarios.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

We found this lab as a great opportunity to learn more about coverage and have hands on experience in regard to using covrage tools and writing test to increase the coverage. it also gave us the opportunity collaborate and demonstrate more peer testing features. In addition we found this lab to be a good opportunity to address issues in range classes. For feedback, it would be nice to have clearer steps for working with EclEmma and the configuration process.
